## What is it?

<i class="icon-tint icon-large"></i> Drupid is a better replacement for [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush)'s `drush make`. Drupid does not only build a Drupal platform based on a makefile: it **synchronizes** a Drupal's platform with a makefile!

Drupid is not a clever guy after all. It basically does only three things:

- <i class="icon-li icon-ok"></i> synchronizes a site with a makefile;
- <i class="icon-li icon-ok"></i> helps you create patches easily;
- <i class="icon-li icon-ok"></i> generates dependency graphs.

Drupid is not meant to be a replacement for Drush in its entirety. Rather, Drupid just provides a simpler and more efficient way of managing the code of your Drupal sites by exploiting makefiles the way they should.

Ah, and Drupid supports [installation profiles](http://drupal.org/node/306267) and [multisite](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/multi-site), too!
